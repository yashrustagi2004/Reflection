  "answer_text": "I have worked with Django ORM for about 3 years in my previous role. When dealing with performance issues, I usually start by using Django's select_related() and prefetch_related() methods to reduce database queries. For complex queries, I use the Django Debug Toolbar to identify N+1 problems. I also implement database indexing on frequently queried fields and sometimes use raw SQL for very complex operations. In one project, I reduced query time from 2 seconds to 200ms by optimizing the ORM queries and adding appropriate indexes.",

## Scoring Algorithms

### Weighted Scoring System
```python
def calculate_overall_score(criteria_scores, weights):
    """
    Calculate weighted overall score
    Default weights:
    - Technical Accuracy: 35%
    - Communication Clarity: 25% 
    - Completeness: 20%
    - Depth of Knowledge: 20%
    """
    return sum(score * weight for score, weight in zip(criteria_scores, weights))
```

### Adaptive Scoring
- **Experience Level Adjustment**: Scale expectations based on stated experience
- **Question Difficulty Weighting**: Adjust scoring based on question complexity  
- **Domain-Specific Criteria**: Apply specialized evaluation for different technical areas
- **Time Factor Consideration**: Account for answer timing in scoring

### Improvement Tracking
```python
def calculate_progress_metrics(historical_scores):
    """
    Calculate improvement trends and patterns
    - Score trend analysis (improving/declining/stable)
    - Consistency measurement 
    - Category-specific progress
    - Achievement milestone tracking
    """
    return progress_metrics
```
